Welcome to Chronostar-TNG's documentation!
==========================================
**Chronostar** is a Python library for discovering and characterising
unbound stellar associations (aka
"`moving groups <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_kinematics#Moving_groups>`_")
and their members using
features such as kinematics, age markers, chemical composition. The code 
can be found on `github <https://github.com/tcrundall/chronostar-tng/>`_.

This documentation details the usage of the next generation of Chronostar
code.

It turns out fitting Gaussian Mixture Models is quite complex, so a lot of
the API design (`Buitinck et al. 2013 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238>`_) will be shamelessly *inspired* by
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html>`_.
